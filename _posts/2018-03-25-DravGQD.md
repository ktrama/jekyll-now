In a previous [post](https://github.com/PhyloStar/dravidian-dating/wiki/Is-the-Dravidian-family-3800-or-4500-or-5000-years-old%3F) I observed that without the calibration date for South Dravidian I languages (including Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada) , the age of Dravidian family turns out to be 1000 years younger than inferred dates from an [analysis](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/3/171504) which uses calibration dates.

In this post, I will look at the quality of the inferred trees by running a MCMC chain without any topological constraints and calibration constraints. I will run the MCMC chain for 3 million states and sample at every 500th state. I will use 
1. Uniform prior which infers rooted trees where the distance from root to tip is the same for all the tips
2. Unrooted tree prior that has no root where the branch lengths are drawn from a Gamma-Dirichlet prior
3. Rooted tree prior that has branch lengths drawn from exponential prior with rate 1.0

The first two priors are in MrBayes whereas the third prior is part of [CyBayes](https://github.com/PhyloStar/CyBayes) package that I implemented for linguistic purposes.

I made a gold standard tree as given in [Glottolog](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/drav1251). The tree is shown below:![Gold Tree](https://github.com/PhyloStar/dravidian-dating/blob/master/glotLog.tre.png)

Now, I will measure the quality of the inferred trees in the posterior sample through Generalized Quartet Distance ([GQD](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020109)) which is widely used in linguistic phylogenies papers ([Wichmann et al.](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/221058212x648072), [Greenhill et al.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009573) ). GQD is a generalization of quartet distance that takes polytomies into account when comparing two phylogenetic trees. For instance, the trees returned by phylogenetic software are binary trees whereas the linguistics trees are typically m-ary trees which reflect true split or uncertainty in determining the order of binary splits.

The lower the distance the better is the quality of the inference. I compute the GQD for each tree in the posterior distribution with the gold standard tree and then compute the mean of GQDs over all the posterior trees. I threw away initial 50% of the trees as burnin. The results did not differ if I threw away initial 25% of the trees as burnin.

The GQD results are presented below:

Tree| GQD| No. of Trees
---|---|---
Uniform| 0.3059 ± 0.026| 3045
Unrooted| 0.3204± 0.0242|2001
Rooted| 0.3346 ± 0.0446| 5000

The mean GQD for all the tree priors is within the range of 0.3 to 0.33. When we compare the GQDs with other families such as Indo-European (0.020 [0.015-0.032] for 52 languages) or Austronesian (0.069 ± [0.050-0.100] for 100 languages). The results come from a [work](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~gjaeger/slides/slides_Jena_2017.pdf) presented at [CESC](https://www.shh.mpg.de/cescjena2017) in Jena, Germany (also a forthcoming short paper [accepted](https://naacl2018.wordpress.com/2018/03/02/list-of-accepted-papers/) at NAACL 2018).

The distances for Dravidian are not within the same ballpark suggesting that in the case of **Dravidian, lexical cognates might not have enough information to infer tree that is close to the gold standard tree**.
